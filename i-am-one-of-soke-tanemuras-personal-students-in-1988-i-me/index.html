<p>From 1992 to 1995, with Soke's direct permission, I studied under Ron Tosen Shihan (Master) and Shibu-cho of the Genbukan Tokyo Shibu Dojo. I studied under Ron Shihan until my Sandan in Ninpo Taijutsu. And just as Soke intended, Ron Shihan was extremely influential in my development. </p><p> My years with Soke Tanemura have been filled with wonder, learning and growth. Without his guidance, I would not be the person I am today. He has trained my heart and mind, as well as, my body. He has shown me how to be a better human being, as well as, a much better Martial Artist. Further, I believe without Tanemura Sensei's guidance and nurturing, I would never have met my other teachers; and, even if somehow I did, I would not have qualified for the gifts they have also given me. </p><p> Over the years, I have received the following titles and certificates from Grandmaster Tanemura: </p><ul><li>Kyoshi</li><li>Shibu-cho</li><li>Ryokudan (6th Degree Black Belt) GWNBF Ninpo Taijutsu</li><li>Nanadan (7th Degree Black Belt) KJJR Jujutsu</li><li>Menkyo level (equivalent to 9th Dan) Asayama Ichiden Ryu Taijutsu</li><li>Chuden level Biken-jutsu (Secret Sword Fighting)</li><li>Shoden Menyo Bo-jutsu</li><li>Shoden Menkyo Gyokko Ryu</li><li> Shoden Menkyo Gikan Ryu</li><li>Shoden Menkyo Shinden Fudo Ryo</li><li>Shoden Menkyo Shinden Tatara Ryu</li><li>Shoden Menkyo Koto Ryu</li><li>Shoden level Naginata Jutsu</li><li>2nd Kyu (Teaching certificate) Chugoku Kenpo</li></ul><p><b>Qigong & Chinese Martial Arts:</b></p><p> In 1991, I was extremely fortunate to have received permission from Tanemura Sensei to Study Chinese Martial Arts. After looking for many months, I found and was accepted as a student by the late Master Chen Wei Gun in Qigong and the Chinese Internal Martial Art of Taijiquan.  I am Master Chen's most senior student and second highest ranked in his organization with the title of full Sifu in Qigong and Taijiquan. Master Chen was as close and dear to me as a father.  Due to the influence of Master Chen, I came to realize that Everything we do is, or should be, a form of Qigong. After all, what would we possibly want to do without the conscious control of our energy? Who truly wants to unconsciously spend a portion of their finite Life-Force?  Even though my Qigong and Taijiquan credentials are from Master Chen Wei Gun, because of Master Chen's and Grandmaster Tanemura's close friendship, I teach Taijiquan and Qigong as part of Grandmaster Tanemura's Kokusai Jujutsu Renmei's Chinese Martial Arts. </p><p> In 2007, I was certified as a Level 4 (Master Level) Qigong Instructor by the National Qigong Association.  In order to enhance my knowledge of Anatomy, Traditional Chinese Medical Theory and Medical Qigong, I studied Shiatsu with Ohashi Sensei; and, in 1997, I successfully completed The Advanced Program of Ohashiatsu.    </p><p><b>Yoga </b></p><picture>

<p> After studying parts of Yoga for 25 years, in 1998 I was again blessed to find Yogiraj Swami Bua, Maharaj of Hatha Yoga. </p><p>After 3 months, I asked Swami Ji if he would teach me all of Yoga. He said yes; and more surprisingly, he said I was the first student to ever ask him that question.  Swami Bua has been an inspiration to me in all matters. </p><p>He has shown me I need to have the courage of a lion, the fierceness of a tiger and the heart of a saint. </p><p> Swami Ji has given me permission to teach: </p><ul><li>His Hatha Yoga Routine  </li><li>His Rope Yoga </li><li>His Hindu Wrestling Floor Exercises </li><li>His Indian Club Exercises </li><li>Under his guidance, I qualified for the E-500 hour   Registered Yoga Teacher Certification from the   Yoga Alliance </li><li>In 2005, I trained in Bikram's Hot Yoga with Bill Arce   at the Y+ Yoga Center in Shanghai, China. </li><li>In 2006, I received the Prestegious "Preferred Yoga   Teachers" Award from the Health & Yoga Site. </li></ul><p><b>Thai Yoga </b></p><p> In 2004, I received certification in Thai Yoga Levels I & II from Jonas Westring. </p><p>Thai Yoga is a powerful ancient Modality which incorporates proper bio-mechanical alignment principles and various yoga applications to enhance and balance your Internal Energy, Well-Being and increase your flexibility.    </p><p><b>Personal Training</b></p><p> In 2004, I also received my Personal Training Certification from the National Academy Of Sports Medicine. </p><p>Their Optimum Performance Training is an Integrated Training Program designed to enable the trainee to utilize his/her Kinetic Chain (the Kinetic Chain is composed of your Skeletal System, Nervous System and Muscular System) to its fullest potential. </p><p>This is accomplished through Integrated Training; and includes: </p><ul><li> Integrated Flexibility Training</li><li>Integrated Cardiorespiratory Training</li><li>Neuromuscular Stabilization (balance),</li><li>Core Stabilization, Integrated Strength Training and Reactive Neuromuscular (power) Training. </li></ul><p> I am also certified by the National Academy of Sports Medicne as a Senior Fitness Specialist.    </p><p><b>Pilates </b></p><p> Having trained in and having personally used for over 30 years the principles which Joseph Pilates based his system on, I find that adding many of his exercises and equipment (especially the reformer) to my training routines is a natural expansion of my training routines. </p><p>I am certified by June Kahn in Pilates Mat and Reformer.    </p><p><b> Kettlebells </b></p><p> In 2004, I started to train with Kettlebells and discovered they offered unique training exercises that were,in many cases, unique to Kettlebells. </p><p>I especially like their emphasise on one arm variations of the explosive Olympic lifts and on absorbing force by using the Taijiquan concept of coiling. </p><p>I am certified as a Kettlebell instructor by Kettlebell Concepts.    </p><p>Most importantly, all of my personal instructors believe in the Goodness that is the True Nature of a man's Heart. </p><p>However, they also believe it takes hard work to hone ourselves into the instrument of goodness we were born on this Earth to be. </p><p> I intend to keep their traditions alive by giving my students the knowledge they deserve, the discipline they need and the help they require. </p><p>My mission and the objectives of my instructors is to give my students the tools necessary to accomplish their goals.   </p><p> Very Sincerely Yours, </p><p> Gary Giamboi, Kyoshi, Shibu-Cho, Sifu, E-500 RYT, CPT</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="28"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="30"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="31"><span data-reactid="32"><!-- react-empty: 33 --><h2 data-reactid="34"><a data-reactid="35">Gary Giamboi Kyoshi</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="36"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="37"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="38"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="39"></div></section></div></div>
